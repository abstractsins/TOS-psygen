# TOS-psygen
Fake Psychic Will generator for Town of Salem

Hello! What you have here is a JavaScript node program used to assist you when playing the online game 'Town of Salem.' It is simply a tool I made because I can.

FIRST: it should be run in the terminal like this - "node path/TOS-psygen.js NUMBER", where number is your player number in the game.
Instructions will appear on screen.

What does this program do?
The program generates random numbers based on certain parameters and options.
The program will prompt you => Enter "good" or "evil" to recieve 2 or 3 random numbers, respectively. The numbers are 1-15 because there are 15 players. 
If you want different numbers, press enter to re-draw.
It automatically excludes your number, and does not repeat numbers within a vision. 
Instead of a vision type you can enter a number. The number will be excluded from visions.
You should do this for dead players or possibly your evil teammates, or anyone else you may want to exclude. 
If you want to undo exluding a number, simply enter it again.
